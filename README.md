### Lulu's Bites ###

A bakery for a client that bakes loverly cakes, as well pasteries and "small chops". The site 
was built using plain HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JS to handle dynamic theme handling. Changes made 
to the theme are persisted to Local Storage so the user has the choice of selecting either.
